# PrivateBot
A discord bot written for my and friends personal use, published on Github for educational purposes and code archiving.

An in-depth code documentation is available [here](./docs).

This bot is written in TypeScript and uses the discord.js library. It is designed to be modular and easily extensible. The bot is designed to be run on a private server, it **does not** give you standard administration privileges.

A description how to setup the bot's `.env` file can be found in its [example template](./docs/.env.example).
